NEVER put fingers or objects into electrical outlets, toasters, or any other appliance EVEN IF IT IS TURNED OFF!
Keep appliances and cords away from kids, bathtubs and sinks.
Use plug covers on unused outlets.
Because electricity can travel down the strings on kites and balloons, have kids play with them only in open areas away from electrical wires, because they can cause shock or fire.
Teach children to recognize Danger High Voltage signs and stay away from power lines, sub-stations and pad-mounted transformers.
Do not let kids climb trees near power lines.
